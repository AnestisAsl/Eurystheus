# Eurystheus

A full stack web application, which was my dissertation assignment for my univeristy. I could also name this **"mastering the basics"**, since it was my first large web development project. It is not pure vanilla JS since i used libraries like jQuery and AJAX but it is developed without using frontend or backend frameworks. Read the very detailed .pdf file for more informations like the tech-stack and more. It also contains images as a brief preview of the app.
